        <h2 class="early-life">The beginning of a great story</h2>
       <p> Khabib Abdulmanapovich Nurmagomedov was born to an Avar family on 20 September 1988 in the village of Sildi in the
         Tsumadinsky District of the Dagestan ASSR, an autonomous republic within the Russian SFSR, Soviet Union.
          He has an older brother, Magomed, and younger sister, Amina. His father's family had moved from
          Sildi to Kirovaul, where his father converted the ground floor of their two-story building into a gym. Nurmagomedov grew 
          up in the household with his siblings and cousins.[25] His interest in martial arts began when watching students training at
           the gym. Khabib's training as a child included wrestling a bear when he was nine years old.</p>

      <div class="Becoming-a-great-champion">
        <h2 class="first-gum">Becoming a great Champion</h2>
        <p> As is common with many children in Dagestan, he began wrestling from an early age:
             he started at the age of eight under the tutelage of his father, Abdulmanap Nurmagomedov.
              A decorated athlete and a veteran of the Soviet Army, Abdulmanap had also wrestled from an early age,
              before undergoing training in judo and sambo in the military. Abdulmanap dedicated his life to coaching the 
              youth in Dagestan, in hopes of offering an alternative to the Islamic extremism common to the region</p>
      </div>
      <div class="training">
        <h2 class="moved-to-makhachkala">Training</h2>
        
         In 2001, his family moved to Makhachkala, the capital of Dagestan, where he trained in wrestling from the
         age of 12, and judo from 15. He resumed training in combat sambo, under his father, at 17. According to Nurmagomedov,
          the transition from wrestling to judo was difficult, but his father wanted him to get used to competing in a gi jacket.
          Abdulmanap was a senior coach for the combat sambo national team in the Republic of Dagestan, training several athletes in 
          sambo in Makhachkala, Russia. Nurmagomedov frequently got into street fights in his youth, before focusing his attention 
          on mixed martial arts. Khabib said that, along with his father, three athletes who inspired him were the American boxers

        <h2 class="early-career">Early career</h2>
        <div class="MMA-debut">
            Nurmagomedov made his professional MMA debut in September 2008 and compiled four wins in under a month. On 11 October, he 
            became the inaugural <a href="https://youtu.be/dZWuqXeYY68">Atrium Cup</a> tournament champion, having defeated his three opponents at the Moscow event. Over the next 
            three years, he went undefeated, finishing 11 out of 12 opponents. These included a first-round armbar finish of future
             Bellator title challenger Shahbulat Shamhalaev, which marked his <a href="https://youtu.be/e-_f2uLjQv0">M-1 </a> Global debut. In 2011, he competed in seven fights for
             the ProFC promotion, all of which he won by TKO or submission
        </div>
         <div class="record-16-0">
            A 16–0 record in the regional circuits of Russia and Ukraine generated interest from the Ultimate Fighting Championship 
            (UFC) in signing Nurmagomedov. Later, Nurmagomedov's father revealed in an interview that due to a contract dispute 
            with ProFC they had 11 court cases contesting the legitimacy of Nurmagomedov's UFC contract. After losing six and winning five 
            cases, they reached an agreement and Khabib was able to continue his career.

            In late 2011, Nurmagomedov signed a six-fight deal to compete in the UFC's lightweight division.
             In his UFC debut, on 20 January 2012 at UFC on FX 1, Nurmagomedov defeated <a href="https://th.bing.com/th/id/R.acef6f917b7d6a8eb08cc6085815f8c0?rik=Gt7VIjCBrXkgNw&riu=http%3a%2f%2fheavy.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2011%2f03%2fkamalshalorus1.jpg&ehk=E1iQ9kKOr6lluT9QQpdABdr7YCpI2n5tiSUDUuIdjm0%3d&risl=&pid=ImgRaw&r=0">Kamal Shalorus</a>  via submission in the third round.[42]
            Nurmagomedov next defeated <a href="https://www.superlutas.com.br/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Gleison-Tibau-facebook-GleisonTibau-.jpg">Gleison Tibau</a>  on 7 July 2012 at UFC 148 via unanimous decision, with all three judges scoring the fight 30–27.
             This victory marked the first fight for which he had trained out of the American Kickboxing Academy.
            Nurmagomedov's next fight was against <a href="https://th.bing.com/th/id/R.ccd1055ea2d550aae737a85e5a4e4f7d?rik=4oNuPfJhH2G%2bpw&riu=http%3a%2f%2fmedia.ufc.tv%2fgenerated_images_sorted%2fFighter%2fThiago-Tavares%2fThiago-Tavares_840_right50.png&ehk=4bKBZkJiaicODHiz5aWsTQjwRSnywfEWDhtotWVlXHQ%3d&risl=&pid=ImgRaw&r=0">Thiago Tavares</a>  on 19 January 2013 at UFC on FX 7. He won via KO in the first round. After the fight, 
            Tavares tested positive for Drostanolone, an anabolic steroid, and received a 9-month suspension.

            Nurmagomedov defeated <a href="https://dmxg5wxfqgb4u.cloudfront.net/styles/background_image_xl/s3/2020-12/TRUJILLO-ABEL_HERO.jpg?null&h=ef22722b&itok=54mvVGTp"> Abel Trujillo</a> on 25 May 2013 at UFC 160 via unanimous decision, with all three judges scoring the 
            fight . At the weigh-ins, Nurmagomedov came in over the permitted limit, weighing in at 158.5 lb. He was given two
             hours to cut to the lightweight maximum of 156 pounds but elected instead to surrender a percentage of his fight purse to 
             Trujillo and the bout was contested at a catchweight.[48] In the course of the fight, Nurmagomedov set a new UFC record for
              the most takedowns in a single fight, with 21 successful takedowns out of 28 attempts. </p>

              <p>
                In his fifth UFC fight, on 21 September 2013 at UFC 165, Nurmagomedov faced <a href="https://alchetron.com/cdn/pat-healy-fighter-147f2a5e-f45f-4c10-91c6-f626cf832bd-resize-750.jpeg">Pat Healy</a>  . He dominated the fight
                 and won via unanimous decision, with all three judges scoring the fight . Attending his first post-event press 
                 conference, UFC president Dana White praised the relative newcomer stating, "That slam, when he just scoops him up and 
                 slams him, Matt Hughes style. That reminded me of the old Matt Hughes where he would run a guy across the Octagon and slam
                  him. The kid is exciting. We’re probably going to do big things with this kid.

                In December, Nurmagomedov challenged Gilbert Melendez on social media, with the two then expected to face off at UFC 170
                 on 22 February 2014. However, the bout was cancelled for undisclosed reasons, and Melendez was replaced by 
                 Nate Diaz. However, the match-up was cancelled as Diaz turned the bout down. Nurmagomedov expressed his disappointment,
                  appearing on The MMA Hour,<mark> "If they say that they're willing to fight the best, they should fight the best. If they want, 
                  I'll take them both at once in the cage."</mark>

                Nurmagomedov was briefly linked to a bout with <a href="https://th.bing.com/th/id/OIP.z3JrSQ4CZqqbayhs4SdblAHaEK?rs=1&pid=ImgDetMain">Donald Cerrone </a> on 27 September 2014 at UFC 178. However, the pairing
                 was quickly scrapped after it was revealed that Nurmagomedov had suffered a knee injury. He was later expected to 
                 face Cerrone on 23 May 2015, at UFC 187. However, Nurmagomedov pulled out of the bout on 30 April due to a
                  recurring knee injury and was replaced by John Makdessi.

                The bout with Ferguson was rescheduled for 16 April 2016 at UFC on Fox 19. However, on 5 April, Ferguson pulled out
                 of the bout due to a lung issue. Ferguson was replaced by promotional newcomer <a href="https://th.bing.com/th/id/R.616a954fb91c8abc8f985d36bff5ec08?rik=Ai9JCuJLdtMKNg&pid=ImgRaw&r=0">Darrell Horcher</a>  at a catchweight of

                 However, on 26 September, the UFC announced that Alvarez would instead be defending the title against Conor McGregor.
                  Nurmagomedov voiced his displeasure on social media, calling Alvarez a <mark> "bullshit champ"</mark> for refusing 
                  the fight and opting for a bout with McGregor instead, accusing the UFC of being a <mark> "freak show"</mark>
