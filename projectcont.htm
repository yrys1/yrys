                A bout with Ferguson had been scheduled for the fourth time and was expected to take place on 7 April 2018 at UFC 223.
                 However, on 1 April 2018, it was reported that Ferguson had injured his knee and was to be replaced by Max Holloway.
                  On 6 April, <a href="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GVHkhNkkVdR-GvkxeNrkf7RhfKo=/0x0:2456x3683/1200x800/filters:focal(1079x554:1471x946)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/65293490/1164647683.jpg.0.jpg"> Holloway</a> was pulled from the fight after the New York State Athletic Commission (NYSAC) declared
                  him unfit to compete due to extreme weight cutting, and replaced by Al Iaquinta. Iaquinta's inclusion in the fight was
                controversial: the UFC's first choice to replace Holloway, Anthony Pettis, weighed in 0.2 pounds over the championship
                 limit of 155 pounds and did not choose to re-weigh, and its second choice, Paul Felder, was rejected by NYSAC because he
                  was not in the UFC's rankings at the time of the fight. Only Nurmagomedov was eligible to win the championship, 
                  as Iaquinta also weighed in 0.2 pounds over the championship weight limit. Nurmagomedov dominated the fight and 
                  won via unanimous decision, with scores of 50–44, 50–43 and 50–43, and became the UFC Lightweight Champion.

                    On Friday, 3 August 2018, the UFC announced that Nurmagomedov would make his first defence of his lightweight title
                     against Conor McGregor at UFC 229 on October 6 in Las Vegas. In the fight, Nurmagomedov won the first two 
                     rounds, but lost the third round to McGregor. It was the first time Nurmagomedov lost a round in his UFC career.
                      He managed to defeat McGregor in the fourth round via submission. After the contest, Nurmagomedov 
                     scaled the Octagon and tried to attack McGregor's teammate Dillon Danis, which resulted in a brawl between the two
                     teams.After the bout against the Irishman, Khabib improved his record to 27–0 which was then the longest win
                     streak in UFC history. The event drew 2.4 million pay-per-view buys, the most ever for an MMA event

                <h3>Incident at UFC 229</h3>
                <p>
                    On 6 October 2018, following his victory over Conor McGregor at UFC 229, Nurmagomedov jumped over the octagon fence
                     and charged at McGregor's cornerman, Dillon Danis. Danis had reportedly shouted insults at Nurmagomedov. Soon 
                     afterwards, McGregor and Abubakar Nurmagomedov, Khabib's cousin, attempted to exit the octagon, but a scuffle broke
                      out between them after McGregor punched Abubakar, who then punched him back.[93][94] McGregor was then attacked 
                      from behind inside the octagon by two of Nurmagomedov's cornermen, Zubaira Tukhugov and Esed Emiragaev.
                       Tukhugov, a Chechen fighter, was scheduled to fight on 27 October 2018 at UFC Fight Night: Volkan vs. 
                       Smith against Artem Lobov, the McGregor team member who was confronted by Nurmagomedov in April 2018. 
                       Tukhugov was removed from the card on 17 October.</p>
                       <img class="conflict-img" src="https://th.bing.com/th/id/OIP.VtLQJ1Uly0_q57pMvi45gQHaE8?rs=1&pid=ImgDetMain" alt="">

                   <p> Nurmagomedov's payment for the fight was withheld by the Nevada State Athletic Commission (NSAC) as a result, pending 
                    an investigation into his actions. He appeared at the post-fight interview and apologized to the NSAC, saying he was provoked
                     by McGregor's trash talk and the UFC 223 bus incident, adding, "You cannot talk about religion. You cannot talk about nation.
                      Guys, you cannot talk about these things. This is very important to me." He later posted on Instagram that he had warned 
                      McGregor that he would pay for everything he had done on 6 October. Khabib's father, Abdulmanap, later said he did not hold 
                      a grudge towards McGregor and invited him to Russia to train.</p>

                   <p>The NSAC filed a formal complaint against both Nurmagomedov and McGregor, and on 24 October, the NSAC voted to approve a motion to 
                    release half of Nurmagomedov's $2 million fight payout immediately. Both Nurmagomedov and McGregor received indefinite bans until
                     an official hearing would determine the disciplinary outcome of the post-fight brawl. On 29 January 2019, the NSAC announced 
                     a nine-month suspension for Nurmagomedov (retroactive to 6 October 2018) and a $500,000 fine. He was eligible to compete again on
                     6 July 2019. McGregor also received a six-month suspension and $50,000 fine, while Abubakar Nurmagomedov and Zubaira Tukhugov
                     each received 12-month suspensions and fines of $25,000. Khabib Nurmagomedov complained about the NSAC's decisions and stated he
                      no longer wished to compete in the state of Nevada

                    In June 2019, Nurmagomedov signed a new multi-fight contract with the UFC. In the first fight of his new deal,
                     Nurmagomedov made the second defence of his title against interim lightweight champion Dustin Poirier on 7 
                     September 2019 in the main event at UFC 242. He won the fight via a rear naked choke submission in the 
                     third round. The win unified both titles and earned Nurmagomedov his second Performance of the Night bonus 
                     award. He and Poirier swapped shirts after the fight as a show of respect. In his post-fight interview 
                     Nurmagomedov said that he would be selling the shirt Poirier gave him and donating the proceeds to Poirier's 
                     charity. The shirt sold for $100,000 and the donation was matched by UFC president Dana White.

                        Nurmagomedov was scheduled to defend his title against Tony Ferguson on 18 April 2020 at UFC 249. This was 
                        the fifth time that a fight between the pair had been scheduled, and both fighters were on 12–fight win streaks
                         in the UFC.[109] However, Nurmagomedov was unable to leave Russia because of restricted air travel due to the 
                         COVID-19 pandemic, and so was removed from the card.[110] Ferguson instead faced top contender Justin Gaethje 
                         for the interim UFC Lightweight Championship at UFC 249, which was postponed to 9 May. Gaethje won the fight
                          by fifth–round TKO, thus ending Ferguson's win streak and securing himself a shot at the undisputed title 
                          against Nurmagomedov.

                            Nurmagomedov faced Gaethje in a unification bout on 24 October 2020 in the main event at UFC 254.
                           Nurmagomedov won the fight via technical submission with a triangle choke in the second round to defend
                            and re-unify the UFC Lightweight Championship. In his post-fight interview, Nurmagomedov announced his 
                            retirement from mixed martial arts. He explained that he had promised his mother that he would not continue
                             to fight without his late father, "No way I'm going to come here without my father. It was first time
                            after what happened with my father, when UFC called me about Justin, I talk with my mother three days.
                             She doesn't want me to go fight without my father but I promised her it was going to be my last fight.
                            If I give my word, I have to follow this. It was my last fight here." This win earned him the
                            Performance of the Night award. Daniel Cormier claimed in an episode of DC & Helwani, after the 
                             fight, that Khabib had said he chose the triangle choke instead of an arm bar in order to prevent
                             Gaethje from being injured.
